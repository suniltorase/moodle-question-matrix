New features:

  * add k' grading type
  * translate to french
  * display correct answer when reviewing
  * ...

The 1.9 is a backport of the 2.0 version to moodle 1.9. The backport adds a few features:

  * remove the need for moodle to be patched
  * add features for added for the moodle 2.0 version
  * make the 1.9 version compatible with the 2.0 - i.e. uses the same column names

Version 2.2 adds support for the new question engine of Moodle 2.2 as well as more streamlined user interface.

To get the source code you must select the right repository under the source tab: 2.0, 1.9 or default for Moodle 2.2.
